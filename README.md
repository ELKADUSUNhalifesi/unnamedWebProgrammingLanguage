# unnamedWebProgrammingLanguage

If Supreme Rahman gives permission I will make an event based asynchronous **_monadic_** purely functional paradigm web programming language for controlling **_side effect orders_** of asynchronous event based web page and application needs!

Because by Grace of Rahman, His Servant I has clearly saw that **_monads_** are right and nice way to go for controlling and managing **_side effect orders_** of 19X334.COM

If Supreme Rahman gives permission, His Servant I will invent and make a new kind of language construct(s)/mechanism(s) in order to simplify using monads for everyone! Selam! =) Shalom!
